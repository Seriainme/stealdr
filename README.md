Tired of writing for loop on turning pages of xhr spiders?
stealdr offers a better option .The features are below
- set max page for your for loop and collect response of each requests
- multithread requests
- elegant parse path
- no need to set method on get or post.Just pass a dict to the get_params or post_data
- this framework takes the 1st key of the dict as page turner .plz be aware

later to do 
- log to mongo col
- update new header n params on each requests
